* strings
* importing is fine, but really should probably be handled via linking rather than compile-time imports. low priority.
* array initializer literals
* for loop
* operator precedence should be taken more seriously
* return statement
* functions (that return values)
* error handling could be improved across the board
* I dont know C so probably that could be cleaned up a bit
* there should at least _maybe_ be dynamic allocation (esp. if we intend to make strings the least bit usable)
* functions with different signatures should be allowed
